# Cursor Rules

A comprehensive collection of development rules and standards for use with Cursor IDE.

## Overview

This repository contains a curated set of development rules designed to enhance productivity, maintain code quality, and standardize development practices when working with Cursor IDE. These rules cover various aspects of software development, from coding standards to project management.

> **DEPRECATION NOTICE**: The single `.cursorrules` file format is deprecated. All rules should now be stored as individual `.mdc` files in the `.cursor/rules/` directory. This allows for better organization, easier updates, and more focused rule management.
